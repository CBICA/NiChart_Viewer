![NiChart Logo](./NiChart_Viewer/resources/nichart_viewer_logo_s1.png)

NiChart viewer **[NiChart_Viewer]** is a toolbox for visualization of NiChart image descriptors and biomarkers. 

## Notes

The current version is primarily designed for visualizing NiChart_DLMUSE variables (regions of interest - ROIs) together with age centile curves of select ROIs derived from NiChart reference data.

## Installation

```shell
conda create -n NiChart_Viewer python=3.8.8
conda activate NiChart_Viewer
conda install pip
pip install .
```

## Usage

```shell
NiChart_Viewer --data_file infile1.csv --data_file infile2.csv ...
```

## Quickstart

```shell
cd examples/IXI_ROIs
./run_nichart_viewer_IXI.sh
```

The script launches the viewer using the public IXI dataset as an example (DLMUSE ROIs + demog. file with Age and Sex columns).

After launching the viewer, users can view data tables and select ROIs, correct ROIs for intra-cranial volume (ICV), merge ROI values with demographic variables (Age and Sex), view data distributions and scatter plots of variable pairs, and plot selected variables against NiChart reference centile curves
